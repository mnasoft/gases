CEA Database Overview
The CEA thermo database used here has data for over 2000 chemical species. Species are broadly grouped into two types, products and reactants (the latter only existing as a reactant not as an equilibrium product). However, within these categories species may be in a solid, liquid or gaseous state. Where a chemical species is present in different states or in ionic forms, these are treated as distinct species (e.g. the element hydrogen and its positive and negative ions is represented as 3 distinct species: H, H+ and H-).
The species data is in the form of empirical coefficients for a polynomial function of temperature (capable of calculating specific heat capacity, enthalpy and entropy at a given temperature). These coefficients are provided for up to 3 temperature intervals (by and large, 200 - 20,000 K) though for some reactant species no interval is provided.
The database format is ASCII, with 80-column records split into fields of defined (field-dependent) widths.
Fields
For a given species there are between 2 and 11 records depending on the number of provided temperature intervals (0-3). Each temperature interval has 3 records, detailed here in Record 3, 4 and 5. For multiple temperature intervals (nonionic gases have 2, or 3 in the case of monatomic species and simple molecules) these records are repeated for each interval.
Included in this is shorthand for the field columns and data type. In the case of strings and integers it's fairly obvious (int is a 1 digit integer, 2int is a 2-digit integer, 15str is a 15-digit string, etc). For floats, the shorthand mirrors pythonic formatting, so a 10.3f is a float comprised of a 10-digit integer and a 3-digit decimal component. Note that in the database, FORTRAN 77 differentiates between floats and doubles whereas python doesn't. Therefore, doubles have been described here as floats.
Record 1
•	Species name/formula (cols 1-15, 15str). This serves as an ID. Note that 'l' is represented by L and condensed phases designated as α, β, γ or δ are renamed a, b, c or d due to ASCII limitations.
•	Comments (cols 16-80, 65str). These include references in the format of author, year or page and date in the case of TRC tables. When heat of formation is taken from a separate reference, this is included as Hf:<ref>. Reference elements or species used for heat of formation calculations are indicated by Ref-Elm or Ref-Species.
Record 2
•	Number of temperature intervals (col 2, 2int).
•	Reference-Date code (cols 4-9, 6str). This includes a character indicating a general reference followed by a date (e.g. g indicates that NASA Glenn was the source of significant work in deriving the data and 10/96 indicates the month/year).
•	Chemical formula (cols 11-50, 2str + 6.2f). This is a set of 5 element/atom, number pairs. In the vast majority of cases the numbers are integers but in some cases they are non-integer, so floats are used.
•	Phase (col 52, int). Zero for gas, nonzero for condensed phases.
•	Molar mass (cols 53-65, 13.5f). Originally labelled molecular weight (in units g/mol).
•	Heat of formation (cols 66-80, 13.5f). In the case of condensed species this is actually an assigned enthalpy (equivalent to the heat of formation at 298.15 K). Units J/mol.
Record 3
•	Temperature range (cols 2-21, 2x 10.3f). The minimum and maximum bounds for the current temperature interval. Units, K.
•	Number of coefficients (col 23, int). This is always 7 in this data (though the database format supports 8, see section Redundancy).
•	Polynomial exponents (cols 24-63, 8x 5.1f). These are always [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4] in this data.
•	{H(298.15) - H(0)} (cols 66-80, 15.3f). This is the difference between the heat of formation at the enthalpy at T = 0 K.
Record 4
•	Coefficients 1-5 (cols 1-80, 5x 16.8f).
Record 5
•	Coefficients 6-8 (cols 1-48, 3x 16.8f). The 8th is not used in this data (see section Redundancy).
•	Integration constants (cols 49-80, 2x 16.8f). Used in evaluation of enthalpy and temperature-dependent component of entropy, respectively.
Redundancy
The current version of the database has built-in redundancy.
•	The polynomials use 7 coefficients but there is room for 8.
•	Variable temperature intervals are supported (and used for non-gaseous species).
•	The polynomial can be defined in terms of variable, non-integer temperature exponents. In practice, the exponents are both integer and common across all species.
States
All data is provided for species in their standard state at the specified temperature. For gases, this is the standard-state pressure of 1 bar (100,000 Pa). For condensed species this is the standard atmosphere pressure, 1 atm (101,325 Pa).
For chemical elements, the reference state is the stable state at 298.15 K. For gaseous elements at this temperature (and the standard-state pressure), the reference state is a gas over the entire temperature range. Condensed elements are treated as condensed over the temperature range with phase-transitions. These are identified by Ref-elm or Ref-species in the comments.
The universal gas constant is defined as R = 8.314510 J/mol/K.
